This project is a **Python game** that combines fun with learning. Players first **choose a turtle color** and watch a race unfold. After the race:
- If the chosen turtle wins → the player answers a **cybersecurity quiz** to gain bonus points.
- If the chosen turtle loses → the player still gets a chance to answer and score points.

🎯 The goal: **Guess the winner + learn basic cybersecurity concepts in a fun way.**
